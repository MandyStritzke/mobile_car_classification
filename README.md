# mobile_car_classification


Using the stanford car classification dataset(http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) , we want to train a classifier and deploy it to an iOS application.


First step is a bash-script to bring the data in a classes-by-folder structure:
  train/class/img and test/class/img. 
  with a split of 90/10.
